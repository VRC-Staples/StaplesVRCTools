# Staples VRC Tools

A Blender add-on for VRC avatar workflow, featuring elastic clothing fitting with live preview and armature display utilities.

**Compatible with Blender 3.0+** (3.x, 4.x, 5.x)

## Features

### Elastic Clothing Fit

Fits clothing meshes onto body meshes using a high-poly proxy for smooth deformation, with full UV preservation and live preview.

- **Proxy-based fitting** — Subdivides a temporary proxy mesh for smooth shrinkwrap results, then transfers displacements back to the original clothing topology
- **Live preview** — Adjust sliders and see changes in real-time before committing; mesh selectors lock during preview to prevent accidental changes
- **UV preservation** — Original UVs are saved and restored after fitting
- **Preserve group** — Exclude vertex groups from fitting (e.g. waistbands, collars) with smooth follow blending
- **Adaptive displacement smoothing** — Automatically smooths sharp displacement jumps in concave areas while leaving smooth regions untouched
- **Live smooth preview** — Corrective smooth and Laplacian smooth are applied as live viewport modifiers during preview so you see the final result before applying
- **Post-fit options** — Optional corrective smooth, symmetrize, and Laplacian smooth passes applied on finalize
- **Offset fine-tuning** — Per-vertex-group offset influence overrides (0–200%) for precise local control of the body gap
- **Advanced adjustments** — Fine-tune smoothing passes, gradient thresholds, blend ranges, and follow parameters
- **Undo support** — Remove Fit restores the original mesh at any time
- **Reset defaults** — One-click reset of all sliders to default values

> Elastic Clothing Fit is also available as a [standalone add-on](https://github.com/VRC-Staples/Elastic-Clothing-Fit).

### Armature Tools

- **Apply Stick + In Front** — Sets all armatures to Stick display type with In Front enabled (including hidden armatures)

## Installation

### Full Suite (Elastic Fit + Armature Tools)

1. Download `StaplesVRCTools.zip` from the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. In Blender, go to **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons**
3. Click **Install** and select the downloaded `.zip` file
4. Enable **Staples VRC Tools** in the add-on list

The panel appears in **View3D > Sidebar (N) > StaplesVRCTools**.

## Usage

### Fitting Clothing

1. Select the **Body** and **Clothing** meshes in the panel
2. Adjust **Fit Amount**, **Offset**, and other settings as needed
3. Click **Fit Clothing** — the fit runs and enters **preview mode**
4. In preview mode, adjust any slider to see live updates:
   - **Fit Amount** — How far clothing moves toward the body (0 = none, 1 = full snap)
   - **Offset** — Gap between fitted surface and body
   - **Elastic Strength / Iterations** — Corrective smooth visible live in the viewport
   - **Laplacian Smooth** — Toggle and tune Laplacian smoothing visible live in the viewport
   - **Displacement Smoothing** — Controls for adaptive crease smoothing (under Advanced)
   - **Offset Fine Tuning** — Per-vertex-group offset multipliers (under Advanced)
5. Click **Apply** to finalize (bakes smoothing, runs symmetrize if enabled) or **Cancel** to revert

> **Note:** Proxy Resolution, Preserve UVs, and Symmetrize cannot be changed during preview — they are grayed out with an indicator. Cancel and re-fit to change them.

### Preserve Group

To keep parts of the clothing in place (e.g. a waistband):

1. Create a vertex group on the clothing mesh with weight on the vertices to preserve
2. Select that group in the **Preserve Group** dropdown
3. Preserved vertices will follow the fitted mesh smoothly based on **Follow Strength**

### Post-Fit Options

These options can be set before fitting or adjusted during preview, and are finalized when you click **Apply**:

- **Shape Preservation** — Corrective smooth to maintain the original silhouette. Strength and iteration count can be adjusted live during preview.
- **Laplacian Smooth** — Additional smoothing pass to reduce noise. Can be toggled on/off and tuned live during preview.
- **Symmetrize** — Mirror one side to the other along a chosen axis. Must be configured before fitting; this option is not available during preview and is applied on finalize only.

### Offset Fine Tuning

Available under **Advanced Adjustments**, this lets you override the body gap for specific areas of the mesh:

1. Expand **Advanced Adjustments** and scroll to **Offset Fine Tuning**
2. Click **Add Group** to add an entry
3. Select a vertex group from the clothing mesh
4. Set the **Influence** slider (0–200%):
   - **100%** — No change from the base offset (neutral)
   - **0%** — Those vertices are pulled flush to the body surface
   - **200%** — Those vertices are pushed twice as far as the base offset
5. Add as many groups as needed; click **−** on an entry to remove it

Changes to influence sliders update live during preview. Changing which vertex group is selected also updates live and recomputes the per-vertex weights immediately.

## Slider Reference

| Slider | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Fit Amount | 0.65 | Blend factor toward the body surface |
| Offset | 0.001 | Gap between clothing and body |

| Preserve UVs | On | Restore original UV coordinates after fitting |
| Elastic Strength | 0.75 | Corrective smooth factor |
| Elastic Iterations | 10 | Corrective smooth passes |
| Follow Strength | 1.0 | How closely preserved vertices track the fit |
| Laplacian Factor | 0.25 | Strength of Laplacian smoothing |

| Influence (per group) | 100% | Per-vertex-group offset multiplier (0–200%) |

## Preview Mode Reference

When a fit is active, the panel enters **Preview Mode**. The following controls are live (changes apply immediately to the viewport):

| Control | Live in Preview |
|---------|----------------|
| Fit Amount | Yes |
| Offset | Yes |
| Elastic Strength | Yes |
| Elastic Iterations | Yes |
| Laplacian Smooth (toggle + sliders) | Yes |
